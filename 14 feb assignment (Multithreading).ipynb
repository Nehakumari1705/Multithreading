    "Ans- \n",
    "\n",
    "#### run():\n",
    "\n",
    "run() is a method that you can define within a custom Thread class or a subclass of the Thread class.\n",
    "It represents the task or job that the thread should execute when it is started.\n",
    "When you call start() on a thread object, it will internally call the run() method to begin the thread's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### start():\n",
    "\n",
    "start() is used to begin the execution of a thread and run the code defined in its run() method.\n",
    "Once you call start() on a thread object, it will create a new thread of execution that runs concurrently with the other threads in the program.\n",
    "You should not call the run() method directly if you want to achieve true multithreading; instead, use start().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### join():\n",
    "\n",
    "join() is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution before moving on to the next part of the program.\n",
    "When you call join() on a thread object, the program will pause and wait until that thread finishes its task.\n",
    "This is often used to ensure that the main thread waits for all other threads to finish before terminating the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### isAlive():\n",
    "\n",
    "isAlive() is a method that checks whether a thread is currently running or not.\n",
    "It returns True if the thread is still active (running) and False if the thread has completed its execution.\n",
    "You can use this method to check the status of a thread and perform actions based on whether the thread is still running or has finished its task."

    "#### Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to do multiple things at the same time, making it more responsive and interactive, especially for tasks involving input/output operations or user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Efficient Resource Utilization: Threads share the same memory space, so they can efficiently use system resources. It reduces the overhead of creating separate processes for different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Faster Execution: In some cases, multithreading can lead to faster execution, as multiple threads can work on different parts of a task concurrently, potentially reducing overall processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity due to the need for synchronization mechanisms (like mutexes) to avoid conflicts when multiple threads access shared resources. Dealing with synchronization can lead to bugs and difficult-to-debug issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Race Conditions: Race conditions may occur when multiple threads try to access and modify shared resources simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior and data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In some programming languages, like Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the true parallelism of CPU-bound tasks with pure Python threads, reducing the performance gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging Difficulties: Debugging multithreaded applications can be challenging, as the timing and order of thread execution can vary, making it harder to reproduce and identify issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, multithreading can greatly improve program responsiveness and resource utilization, but it requires careful management of shared resources and synchronization to avoid potential issues like race conditions and complexity in code. Debugging multithreaded applications can also be more challenging compared to single-threaded ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are stuck because each is waiting for the other to release a resource, causing the program to get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Race Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition is when multiple threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the final result becomes unpredictable because it depends on the specific order of thread execution. This can lead to data corruption or incorrect outcomes."
